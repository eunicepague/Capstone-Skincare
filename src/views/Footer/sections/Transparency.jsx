              <h1>DECIEM – PH Transparency in Supply Chains Act</h1>
              <p>
                DECIEM Beauty Group Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries
                (collectively, "DECIEM," “we,” “us,” “our”) respect human rights
                and recognize the importance of safe working conditions around
                the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a company subject to the California Transparency in Supply
                Chains Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43), we are publicly
                disclosing our efforts to help eradicate slavery and human
                trafficking from our supply chains, so that you may make
                informed decisions when purchasing products.
              </p>

              <h6>1. Verification</h6>
              <p>
                DECIEM implements and maintains policies and procedures that
                require DECIEM as well as its contractors to conduct business in
                a lawful, ethical and responsible manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to engaging any new suppliers, DECIEM internally evaluates
                such suppliers and requires them to operate in compliance with
                DECIEM policies including but not limited to our Supplier Code
                of Conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, in conjunction with
                our standard purchasing contracts, requires that suppliers be in
                full compliance with all applicable governmental, legal,
                regulatory and professional rules and regulations. Our Supplier
                Code of Conduct includes DECIEM’s prohibition on employing
                children, using or benefiting from human trafficking, prison
                labor, indentured labor or bonded labor and engaging in any kind
                of physical, verbal, psychological or sexual abuse, harassment
                or any other forms of intimidation or misconduct.
              </p>

              <h6>2. Supplier Audits</h6>
              <p>
                All new suppliers must agree to comply with our Supplier Code of
                Conduct before they are awarded our business.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the suppliers we share with The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
                (“ELC”), our parent company, ELC contracts with third parties to
                conduct on-site audits for ELC suppliers that are selected based
                on criteria such as geography, type of material and impact to
                the business. ELC also assesses certain ELC suppliers against
                environmental and social criteria using a third-party
                sustainability ratings platform. If non-compliance is
                discovered, then the remedies may include, among other things,
                termination of business with DECIEM or the development and
                implementation of a corrective action plan that would need to be
                implemented within a certain fixed time period.
              </p>

              <h6>3. Certification</h6>
              <p>
                To ensure that our suppliers respect and enforce our company
                standards and applicable laws and regulations, we contractually
                require suppliers to comply with DECIEM policies, including but
                not limited to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and all applicable
                laws and regulations.
              </p>

              <h6>4. Internal Accountability</h6>
              <p>
                Non-compliance with DECIEM policies, including company standards
                regarding slavery and trafficking, can result in corrective
                action or termination, depending on the number of
                non-compliances found and their severity. DECIEM works with our
                employees and suppliers to develop action plans to resolve any
                such instances of non-compliance. While we believe in
                sustainable remediation, we reserve the right to terminate a
                business relationship with an employee or supplier if it is
                deemed necessary.
              </p>

              <h6>5. Training</h6>
              <p>
                All DECIEM employees, including those who have direct
                responsibility for supply chain management, must review and
                agree to comply with our Employee Code of Conduct, so each
                employee is better able to identify and report risks associated
                with unethical or unlawful behavior at any stage in DECIEM’s
                supply chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                An employee who violates a provision of our Employee Code of
                Conduct, condones or knowingly fails to report a possible
                violation, intentionally makes a false report or fails to
                cooperate fully in any investigation of any violation will be
                subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination
                of employment.
